Question:
Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the "stand-alone" tag. This kind of tag combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one. It is identified with a '/'(slash) preceding the final >. (For example, the <foo/> is a stand-alone tag that is "self balancing". Describe briefly how you would modify Requirement 1 to allow this kind of tag. 

Answer:
To modify Requirement 1 to allow stand-alone tags (e.g., <foo/>), the algorithm would need to recognize and handle these tags differently. Stand-alone tags combine both a start-tag and an end-tag in one, so they do not require matching end-tags. When the algorithm detects a tag starting with < and ending with />, it should treat it as a self-contained, self-balancing tag. Specifically, the program should skip pushing stand-alone tags onto the stack and avoid checking for matching end-tags. This modification ensures that stand-alone tags are processed correctly without disrupting the validation of other tags. For example, when encountering <foo/>, the program would recognize it as valid without performing any stack operations, while still validating nested or matching tags like <a><b></b></a>. This approach maintains the integrity of the XML validation process while accommodating stand-alone tags.
